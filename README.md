Wave function in quantum mechanics: It's a mathematical description of the quantum state of a system. The absolute square of the wave function gives the probability density of finding a particle in a certain location.

Schwarzschild geodesics in general relativity: These are the paths followed by objects in the spacetime around a non-rotating, spherical mass, described by the Schwarzschild solution. They show how objects move under gravity's influence in this context.
